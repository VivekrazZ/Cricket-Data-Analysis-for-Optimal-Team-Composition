Cricket, a sport deeply entrenched in tradition, is experiencing a modern transformation through the power of data. "Cricket Data Analysis for Optimal Team Composition" delves into this evolving landscape, employing a comprehensive approach to understand the intricate relationship between data and cricket. At its core, this project seeks to identify the perfect blend of players that can propel a team to victory in this high-octane format.

The project commences with the extraction of data using web scraping techniques, which enables the collection of raw information on player statistics, team line-ups, and match outcomes. This raw data is then systematically processed and transformed into a structured CSV format, meticulously cleansed to ensure its accuracy. By utilizing Microsoft Power BI, the project harnesses the power of data visualization and analysis, enabling us to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. Most importantly, this project applies statistical methodologies to set stringent criteria for player selection, uncovering key performance indicators that are vital in building a winning team. In a realm where cricket tradition meets cutting-edge technology, this project serves as a comprehensive guide for enhancing team performance and strategic decision-making in the cricket domain.
